Gender Pay Gap Analyzer üë©‚Äçüíºüë®‚Äçüíº

## Overview
The **Gender Pay Gap Analyzer** is a data science project designed to analyze wage disparities between genders using real-world datasets. The goal is to explore trends, visualize key insights, and suggest data-driven policies to reduce the gender pay gap.

## Features
- Data collection from open datasets on salaries and demographics
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Statistical analysis of wage differences
- Predictive modeling to identify key factors influencing the pay gap
- Policy recommendations based on findings

## Dataset
The project utilizes publicly available datasets such as:
- [OECD Gender Wage Gap Data](https://data.oecd.org/)
- [World Economic Forum Gender Gap Report](https://www.weforum.org/reports)
- [US Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/)

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis
- **SQL** (optional) for handling large datasets
- **Streamlit** (optional) for interactive visualization

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Gender_Pay_Gap_Analyzer.git
cd Gender_Pay_Gap_Analyzer
```
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Load and preprocess the dataset using `data_processing.py`
2. Perform exploratory analysis using `eda.ipynb`
3. Run the model using `gender_gap_model.py`
4. Generate reports and visualizations

## Results
The project provides:
- Wage disparity trends across industries and regions
- Factors contributing to the pay gap (education, experience, industry, location)
- Predictive insights on wage equality
